# List of files to be converted.

This file contains a list of files that need to be converted.  When conversion is in-progress, annotate the file with your name.  When it is complete, put an 'x' within the square brackets to show that it is done.  Because some doxygen formatted files contain multiple pages, and thus must be pruned into multiple files, this list may grow.  Please keep in alphabetical order.

> See the file `nug_style_guide.md` for information regarding final style of markdown files.  When a file meets the standards expressed there, it is "finished"
