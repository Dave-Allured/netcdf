# Contributing Guide

In order to contribute to the NUG via a pull request, the following guidelines should be followed:

* Changes must stylistically adhere to the guidelines as outlined in the `NUG/nug_style_guide.md` document.
* Changes must be `markdown` compliant.
 	* Because `markdown` is a superset of `HTML`, it is permissible to embed `HTML` in the document. With that in mind,
* Emphasize the readability of the source documents.
* The NUG is meant to be programming-language agnostic, to the extent that it can be.  Language-specific changes should be submitted, via PR, to the documentation in the appropriate project repo.
